#Events Platform

I created a new directory in the terminal entitled 'events_platform' and then proceeded to cd into same directory. </br>
I created a new folder called 'Components' and created a new file called 'Header.jsx', I wrote code in the file to test the output; also created code in the App.jsx file.</br>
I created a new GItHub repository entitled 'events_platform'
